\usage{
rpc(pheno_ind)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno_ind}{The raster stack returned by the kpi() function.}
}
\value{
A probability raster (`Rpheno`), ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the global epidemic risk of bark beetle generation development and thus the risk of attack.
}
\description{
This function calculates the global epidemic risk indicator (`Rpheno`), measuring the probability of successful development of a bark beetle generation based on the indicators `awakening_doy`, `swarming_doy`, and `maturing_doy`, and thus the risk of attack.

\dontrun{
 rpheno <- rpc(pheno_ind)
